Repository for my APCS class

Our group talked about class inheritance and if there was a more sophisticated way to check for nulls. We cleared up a few misconceptions about how to go about using the extended class and override the methods. 

I was having difficulty trying to impelement the method without changing the original method but was reminded I can call the parent class.
